# WhatWeBreathe

## Plotting PMx around you

According to WHO, around *7 million people die every year due to a
          subtle and invisible killer*: **pollution**. Exposure to particles such as
          fine dust can lead to stroke, heart disease, lung cancer and other
          respiratory infection. It is supposed, analyzing infection rates in
          polluted areas, that these particles have facilitated the spread of
          the new Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).

WhatWeBreath is a React-based project made to raise awareness on **fine
          dust pollution**: have you ever wondered what it would be like if these
          **particles** were **visible**? We tried to give an answer.
